Overview of the project

Project: Simple calculator using Python

**Python Programming Language:**

The code is written in Python, a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language widely used for scripting, web development, and data science.

**Input/Output Operations:**

The input() function is used to accept user input.
The print() function is used for displaying outputs and messages to the user.

**Conditional Statements:**

if, elif, and else statements are used for branching logic to handle various operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and invalid inputs.

**Exception Handling:**

The try-except block ensures that the program can gracefully handle invalid inputs (like non-numeric entries) without crashing.

**Arithmetic Operators:**

Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) are performed for the calculator functionality.

**Control Structures:**

Loops (like while) are commonly used in such calculators to allow repetitive actions. This program currently executes once and terminates.
